				<p>
					Strings and characters are strategic ways to implement words and letters into Java. Technically, a String is made
					out of several characters. For example, character 's' would be the "zero-th" index of the string "school", since Java 
					counts from 0. However, if we break apart the String, we'll find that the zero-th index of a String will actually return a String.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's initialize our String; <kbd>String testString = new String("Testing");</kbd>. Notice how we have to use the <i>new</i>
					operator, which we didn't use in Integers, doubles or booleans. When we initialize a String using this method, a new object is being
					created. If we want a literal String, we can do this: <kbd>String literal = "Literally";</kbd>. Both strings work in the exact same
					dynamic, except the first method is creating a new Object of the value String. The literal is simply pointing to the memory space 
					that has "Literally" in it. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If we want to print out a String, all we have to do is: <kbd>System.out.println(testString);</kbd>. Let's look into some
					String methods. What if we want to print out the first letter of "pizza". Since Java starts counting from 0, we can use the 
					substring() method to slice out the p from pizza. Here's how to do it; <kbd>System.out.println(new String("pizza").substring(0,1));</kbd>.
					Looking at the code, it may seem like "pi" was supposed to print, since we included both 0 and 1 in the arguments. However,
					the substring method will cut off the letter at the second index, so "i" was cut off, and we got "p". You can also print
					"zza" by doing <kbd>System.out.println(new String("pizza").substring(2));</kbd>. This print statement will print everything from
					the second index onwards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's look at another String method, length(). .length() does exactly what you would expect - it returns the length of the String.
					Try this: <kbd>System.out.println(new String("hello").length());</kbd>. You should get the length of the String hello. Remember that
					the length() function is a method for a String. This will come in handy when we learn about arrays.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, we can look at the .equals() method. Later on in this course, you'll learn that we can check if two variables are equal
					with the == (equals) operator. However, it doesn't work like that for Strings. Strings, and all Objects, are stored in a memory heap.
					When we do <kbd>stringOne == stringTwo</kbd>, we are just comparing the <i>memory locations for those two objects.</i> If we want
					to compare the values, we have to use the .equals() method like so; <kbd>stringOne.equals(stringTwo)</kbd>. If they are equal, the
					method will return true. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Now let's talk about characters. While a String is an object, a character, like all of the other data types we have learned, is not
					a primitive data type (not an object). This means we won't have to use the new operator to declare and initialize a character
					variable. <kbd>char c = 'd';</kbd>. A character variable is symbolized with the word "char" and the <i>single quotations</i>. If you
					use the double quotations, Java will think you are trying to stuff a String into a character data type, which isn't possible.
				</p>
				
				<img src = "ascii.png">
				
				<p>
					Take a look at this table. It's known as an ASCII table. The Decimal numbers on the left hand side can be substituted for the
					Char values on the right. Let's take a look on how to implement this. <kbd>char c = 'A';</kbd>. This code gives the variable
					<i>c</i> a value of 'A'. We can also do this, <kbd>char c = 65;</kbd> Yup, we can plug a number into a character data type to 
					get the value of the char on the ASCII table.

						<b>Challenge Problem</b>: Create a String object using the new operator and print it to the terminal.
						Create a literal string and print it out. Store the length of both Strings in two different integers and print them out.
						Create a character variable and print it out.
