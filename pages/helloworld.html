				Hello World is one of the most popular and also one of the most easiest methods to introduce first-time programmers to 
				the complicated world of coding. The progammer has to manipulate the <i>System</i> in order to see text on the screen. Let's jump 
				into it!
			</p>
			<p>
				First, let's get set up. In your text editor/IDE, type <kbd> public class First</kbd> followed by an open bracket, {. 
				This is the class in which you will be working in. Now, save the file as First.java. If you save the file as anything other than
				First.java, the program will not compile and fail to run. Make sure your class name and the File name are the <i> exact same.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, you'll want to type this; <kbd>public static void main(String[]args){</kbd>. This is your main method.
				When a program is compiled and ran, your main method will be the first method to be executed. It's important that you 
				copy the statement word for word, else your program may not compile. We're finally getting ready to actually code!
			</p>
			<p>
				Time to code! Type: <kbd>System.out.print("Hello World!");</kbd>. Compile and run the program. Got an error? That's because we
				forgot to close the brackets for the method and class! If we don't encapsulate our methods with brackets, Java won't know
				when that method begins or ends. Add a closing bracket, } , after the print statement to close the method. Add another closing bracket
				after everything, to close the class. Compile the program and run it again. If everything worked out correctly, you should see <b>Hello World!</b> as your output. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's break the code down. When we type <i>System.out</i>, we are actually using a library that java is already installed with. 
				Other libraries, like the Math library need to be imported. We aren't using math however, so let's go back to the code. The .print
				portion of the code is one of the System's methods. It prints everything between the parentheses as output. We need quotations around
				<i>Hello World!</i> since Hello World! is a string. We'll learn more about Strings later. Finally, the semi-colon is Java's way of knowing when
				a line terminates or ends. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Not too shabby! Now, let's get complicated. Let's double our printing! After the print statement, but before the closing bracket
				of the method, add <kbd>System.out.print("Goodbye World!");</kbd>. Done. But, when you compile and run the program, you'll see 
				something's off. The two print statements are connected! Can you think of why? That's right! We are using the simple .print() method 
				that will print on the same line. Let's change the .print() to <kbd>.println()</kbd> for both print statements. After we run the
				program, we'll see that the statements are now on different lines. The reason for this is that the println() method adds a <kbd>\n</kbd>
				after each line, essentially pressing "enter" on your keyboard.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure, you could choose to use the plain print() method and add a \n after every statement to create a new line. But that's 
				far too exhausting and we're all about efficiency. Proffesional programmers will use println() nearly all of the time. Seriously.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Pat yourself on the back! That was pretty simple, right? In our next lesson, we'll begin to look at variables and declarations. 
				Stay tuned!
